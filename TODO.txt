 - Make resources directory location configurable during build.

 - Bug: artifacts when there are too many testing points.
    - Culprit is Intel GPU, investigate how to fix.

 - Handle python errors properly.

 - Use better time discretization.
    - Work with variable time steps.

 - Calculate results averaging over the whole year (not just daytime).

 - Use a thread pool with the optimal number of threads for initialization tasks:
    - Create TaskSlots in parallel, too.

 - Refine mesh in GPU.

 - Add option to specify that refinement is to be used.

 - Add option to specify which GPUs to use.

 - Add option to specify north and up vectors, instead of quaternion.

 - Add option to specify output file.

 - Accumulate results for the same device in a compute shader:
    - Profile to see if this is worthwhile.
    - Allocate a single memory region for all result buffers.

 - Performance experiments:
    - Try compute phase in the dedicated compute queue family, for
      AMD devices.
    - Try transfer in the dedicated compute queue family, for
      Nvidia devices.
