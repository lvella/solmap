 - Bug: artifacts when there are too many testing points.
    - Culprit is Intel GPU, investigate how to fix.

 - Use device local memory for mesh buffer.

 - Use better time discretization.
    - Work with variable time steps.

 - Calculate results averaging over the whole year (not just daytime).

 - Render result as 0 to 1, where 1 is the best possible insolation.
    - Output both normalized and non-normalized values.

 - Use a thread pool with the optimal number of threads for initialization tasks:
    - Create TaskSlots in parallel, too.

 - Refine mesh in GPU.

 - Add option to specify that refinement is to be used.

 - Add option to specify which GPUs to use.

 - Add option to specify north and up vectors.

 - Accumulate results for the same device in a compute shader:
    - Profile to see if this is worthwhile.
    - Allocate a single memory region for all result buffers.

 - Performance experiments:
    - Try compute phase in the dedicated compute queue family, for
      AMD devices.
    - Try transfer in the dedicated compute queue family, for
      Nvidia devices.
