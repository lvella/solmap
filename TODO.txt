 - Use better time discretization.
    - Work with variable time steps.
 - Calculate results averaging over the whole year (not just daytime).
 - Refine the mesh, possibly with tesselation shader.
    - In compute phase, use a single storage buffer for vertex data and
      output, initializing it with the tesselation shader.
 - Use a thread pool with the optimal number of threads for initialization tasks:
    - Create TaskSlots in parallel, too.
 - Accumulate results for the same device in a compute shader:
    - Allocate a single memory region for all result buffers.

 - Performance experiments:
    - Try compute phase in the dedicated compute queue family, for
      AMD devices.
    - Try transfer in the dedicated compute queue family, for
      Nvidia devices.
